Comprises of a simple user interface and intermediate computer artificial intelligence for the user to never be able to win against the program, in a fair game of the classic Tic Tac Toe.
# Notes 
This Tic Tac Toe game V1.0 was initally developed with the Ready to Program (Java IDE) for ICS3U Computer Science programming project completed on Jan 20, 2012. 
Later imported the project to the Eclipse IDE with the appropriate compatibility such as the hsa.Console and JRE 1.4.2 that Ready to Program uses.
For more information about the program, such as the flow chart or algorithms utilized to enhance artificial intelligence played by the computer, please take a look at the report.
# Game Description
You would think that Tic-Tac-Toe is a straightforward game; in fact, you’ll discover that this game isn’t quite as simple as you think! Tic-Tac-Toe involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the computer might do next. You must come up with a strategy to beat the computer. The program will consist of a two dimensional array with three rows and three columns to create the outline of the game. Each of the 9 squares will be given a number and the human player will enter a number when it is their turn to make their mark as X or O. The program will be capable of checking for moves and responding to them. For example, blocking a win by choosing a mark (as in X or O) when it sees that the player has made 2 in a row. The computer will also be able to win the game, if it sees that it only needs one more mark to win it. The program calculates the total amount of wins, losses, and ties for both the player and the computer. The program will also check after each turn, if a player has won or tied. If there are no capable blocks or wins for the computer player, the program will determine the empty squares that are left after each human turn, with the list of empty squares the program will randomly choose one of them for the computer player. As the human player, you must figure out how to get three marks in a row, you also must figure out how to stop the computer from getting three marks’ in a row. You must pay attention and look ahead in order to win games. Although you might not win, you will at least tie. 

# Rules
1. The game is played against the computer on a 3 squares by 3 squares grid. 
2. You have the option to make your mark as X or O.
3. Player X will always go first.  
4. Each player will take turns putting his or her marks in an empty square.
5. The first player to get 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, diagonally, or across) is the winner. 
6. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

# Features
1. Intermediate opponent artificial intelligence.
2. Simple Interface.

# Operating Instructions
1.	Run the code.
2.	You are prompted to enter your choice to play as an x or o. Player x will get the chance to go first and player o will go second.
3.	The tic-tac-toe grid will always be located at the top of the console. You will be prompted to enter a number that is still valid and unoccupied on the grid shown. 
4.	Once an unoccupied number is entered, the player’s symbol (x or o) will occupy the spot as shown on the game board. 
5.	The computer will continue to select a random unoccupied square and his choice will be shown on the updated game board.
6.	Steps 3-5 will be repeated until the game is finished. The game is finished when a player is able to get 3 of their symbols in a row (diagonally, vertically, or horizontally), or when neither players win. 
7.	The program will ask if you want to play again: If you do, enter ‘y’, if you don’t, enter ‘n’. If you do want to play again, steps 2 to 6 are repeated until you do not want to play. If you enter ‘n’ to quit the game, the console will display your total results and some information about the program.
